Here's a vision for the first version:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Game Board Screen:** A grid-based screen where the candy pieces are displayed. This will be the core of the game.\n*   **Matching Logic:** Implement the core game mechanic of swapping adjacent candies to create matches of three or more.\n*   **Scoring System:** A basic scoring system that awards points for each successful match.\n*   **Level Progression:** Start with a simple level progression system, perhaps with increasing difficulty based on the number of candy types or board size.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8E71C` (A bright, cheerful yellow)\n    *   Text: `#34495E` (A dark, readable blue)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#7F8C8D` (A medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#E74C3C` (A vibrant red for interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#9B59B6` (A deep purple for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#F39C12` (A warm orange for highlights)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for candy cards)\n    *   Highlight: `#2ECC71` (A bright green for successful matches)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, rounded font like \"Nunito\" or \"Lato\" for a friendly and approachable feel.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile game app!\n\nI will now create a plan for the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create the Game Board Screen:** Create a new component for the game board. This component will handle rendering the grid of candies.\n2.  **Implement Matching Logic:** Implement the logic for detecting matches of three or more candies. This will likely involve functions to check rows and columns for matching candies after a swap.\n3.  **Implement Scoring System:** Add a scoring system that awards points for each successful match. Display the score on the Game Board Screen.\n4.  **Implement Level Progression:** Implement a simple level progression system. This could involve increasing the number of candy types or the size of the game board as the player progresses.\n5.  **Apply Design Elements:** Apply the specified colors and typography to the app. This will involve modifying the app's theme or style sheet.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-21T00:27:09.221032"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a Candy Crush-like mobile game app!

Be marked as matched\n  2. Play a breaking animation (scale down, rotate, fade out, fall)\n  3. Get removed from the board\n  4. Trigger gravity to make candies above fall down\n  5. New candies fill in from the top\n  6.
